A century after the [[The Cataclysmic Shift]] came the Beast Wars. Up until that point, because Bosciynia was the least populated of the countries, there wasn't a problem with the two living side by side. However, the cohabitation between humans and the beasts had all but ceased to exist as the magic evolved and the people began to settle and grow the country. 

Magic in the people began to evolve over the course of the century. It branched from pure beast magic to other forms. "Pure" beasts were on the decline as well due to the century of cross breeding with the normal wildlife. 

Pack attacks were much more frequent and towns and villages desperately fended for themselves.
