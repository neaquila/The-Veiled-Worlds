The God of Beginnings worshipped primarily by the citizens of [[Bosciynia]] and [[Amane]], though his presence has been found in the architecture of other continents close the Bosciynian peninsula. Churches and temples of religions and other gods from neighboring are found dotted within the country, but those religions are small in comparison. 

[[Church of Suvians]] are tall, intricately carved wooden buildings with dark maroon roofs. 

The worship of the God Suvian is known as Suvianism.

Believers of Suvianism hold the belief that Suvian himself carved the existence of the world with his bare hands, planting the seeds of humanity and waited to watch them grow. He brings upon the storms and rain when needed and decides if and when land returns back to the sea. Folks celebrate his existence when the snow melts and the new bundles of grass shoot up from ground -- the end of winter and the weeks of early spring -- in a festival known as [[The Days of Beginning]].
