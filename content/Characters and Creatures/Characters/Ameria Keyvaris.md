Age: 28
Human
Female
Bi-Sexual

Born in [[Egosa]]

Birth Date: 7th day of [[Lencissa]]

Currently living in [[Shuwell]]

Residing in Shuwell for the moment as a ranger in the [[Order of the Aladur]]. Protecting the town from the enraged beasts of the forests surrounding the city. She is quite happy where she is at. Shuwell is just big enough and the forest provides time away. Occasionally, she writes home to her family in Egosa -- has two older brothers and a half-sister. 

Ameria is fiercely protective of her friends and family, but also does have fun. Not one for a relationship in the current year, but does partake in the occasional Friends With Benefits scenario. This is mostly due the ranger life and being away for long periods of time. 

She graduated at the top of her class in the ranger academy, and is quite skilled in fire magic. Nothing on par of a master practitioner, but some things she can do include pulling a flame from a spark and manipulating its size and ferocity.
