Born in [[Hilstin]]

Birth Date: 15th day of [[Queloh]]

Currently living in [[Shuwell]]

Quiet and reserved ranger along side Ameria. Does his jobs, is good, but tends to keep in the shadows. Always by [[Ameria Keyvaris]]'s side -- an unrequited love as the story will show. Excels at medicine and acrobatics -- has good endurance. Visits his mom and dad and cousin whenever he can. Very much a homebody. He would much rather spend his time at home or in the barracks than out in the woods. More afraid of the beasts, hence why he stays more in medicine when he can.

His family has been on the country for generations and there is talk that they were there before  [[The Cataclysmic Shift]]. Regardless, he has (unbeknownst to him) [[]] in him. He does not realize he has it until the beasts attack Shuwell and he uses the magic to protect citizens who are about to be mauled. 
## Personal Goals
He wants to be more confident in himself and stop being so afraid of facing the beasts. He wants to show others what he is capable of. 

## Set Backs
His timidness is his downfall, but so is the burning desire to prove himself. He becomes more risky and does more dangerous things to show others what he is capable of, and to win over Ameria. The hidden beast magic within him also is just a major setback in general.

## Outcome
Throughout the course of the story, he will become the chosen one. His outcome is dependent on [[Edrin Shahra|Edrin]] and Ameria. Before it is too late he learns how foolish he is being, and may end up sacrificing himself to save the world.
