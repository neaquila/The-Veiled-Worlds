Openings between the two realms that were created over a thousand years ago by the royal family of [[Oryâ€™nara]] during experimentations with magic. These rifts led to beasts of the magical realm to escape, as well as the magic pouring from the rifts. This caused destruction and turmoil for the people of the unnamed country that had no magic and no means to defend themselves. Realizing what they had done, the royal family sought to close many rifts, but not all of them would. 

The power to create and destroy the rifts stayed within the royal family, but the means to do so were gone when one member of the royal family slipped through the rifts and began to live amongst the humans. This meant that the line of rift openers was gone to the royal family and the rifts that were open at that moment stayed open.

The [[Monarchy | Bosciynian Royal Family]] also had ancestors tracing back to Ory'nara after having ventured through the rifts themselves at one point. Many average citizens ventured to and from, but the genetic differences caused many of the human families to raise their hybrid offspring in the forests, or search for a rift to return to a place that would have them treated better. 

The power to open and close the rifts currently resides within [[Ryker Auberon]], who accidentally closed a portal he, [[Edrin Shahra]], and [[Ameria Keyvaris]] stepped through after stumbling upon one in a cave. 

[[Queen Mirsia III]] would use the rifts to send her secret organization of magic users, known as the [[Veiled Shadows]], into Ory'nara to train and hone their magic. 

In the end, after the [[Siege of Bosciynia]], Ryker would ultimately close all of the rifts in the realm and sever the ties between the two worlds permanently.
