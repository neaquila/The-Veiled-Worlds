The peninsula is split into five regions. 

# Boscinyia North
The coldest region of the entire penninsula. It is home to [[Land Formations#Mount Bouchersor|Mount Bouchersor]]. There are two cities that reside in the cold landscape. [[Alemont]] to the north, near the border to Polneria, and [[Olgolchester]] that sits just southwest of [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#Lake Minnelisle|Lake Minnelisle]].

# Boscinyia East
Warmer of the five regions. There is a desert penninsula where at the end is the city of [[Ontfast]]. Just off of the eastern coast of the main land, in [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#The Waters of Stoughnear|The Waters of Stoughnear]]. 

# Boscinyia South
Not as warm as the eastern region of the country, but definitely less cold than the north. Multiple cities reside in the southern region. [[Ovuburn]] on another almost penninsula; [[Hilstin]] along the south western shores; and [[Egosa]] along the west. Two major bodies of water are located in the south -- [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#Brisbo Bay|Brisbo Bay]] and [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#The Romhead Ocean|The Romhead Ocean]]. 

# Boscinyia Center
Home of the capital city of [[Itredence]] where [[Queen Mirsia III]] resides. Auxillary villages surround the captial such as [[Whelmin]] and othets. To the west is [[Shiham]] along the shores of [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#Clifbonear Loch|Clifbonear Loch]] and just south of the [[Land Formations#Quiet Top Hills|Quiet Top Hills]].

# Boscinyia West
The top of the region touches the north, and some of its waters are frigid and travel south. It is the more populous side of the country -- where many ships travel to other regions for trade and such. Along the [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#The Grave Sea|The Grave Sea]] are four cities [[Druemouth Proper]], [[Druemouth]], [[Lishire]], and [[Shigend]]. In the north is the [[Rivers, Lakes, Seas, and Oceans#Gamstone Cove|Gamestone Cove]] and parts of the [[Land Formations#Irritrilam Mountain|Irritilam Mountains]] sit to the south.
